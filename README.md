TCG Tracker allows Pokemon card enthusiats to search and create a collection of cards. Users can search cards by name or by individual sets and see what cards are missing from a set. They can also view and sort the collection by card type, HP or name. With the decks feature they are able to group cards into four customizable sixty card decks.

## Why I Built This

As a collector of pokemon cards I wanted a digital way to view and search for cards I have and may want. I also enjoy building decks with these cards and this app will allowing me to do that easier.
